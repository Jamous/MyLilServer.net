Scrapligo platform drivers
==========================

Scrapli needs drivers for diffrent network platforms. I am including some drivers I have created on my Github, here https://github.com/Jamous/scrapligo_drivers

These will need to be installed in the scrapli platform files, which can be found here: ::

	%USERPROFILE%\go\pkg\mod\github.com\scrapli\scrapligo@v1.2.0\assets\platforms\
	~/go/pkg/mod/github.com/scrapli/scrapligo\@v1.2.0/assets/platforms/
