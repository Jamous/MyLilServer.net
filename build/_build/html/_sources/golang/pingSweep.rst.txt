Pingsweep icmp sweep package
============================

Pingsweep is a go module that will ping every device in a given subnet. It can either automatically grab the subnet, based on connected subnets, or a subnet can be specified. It does this by sending one ICMP echo request, then closing the connection.

Pingsweep is useful for network discovery and filling out IPv4 arp tables.

This module will set off some antivirus programs.
