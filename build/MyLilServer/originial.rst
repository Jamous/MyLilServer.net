Original MyLilServer.net
===========================================

The original My Lil Server was a learning project written from Scratch in HTML and hosted on an Ubuntu VM.
It took 6 months from purchasing an old server, becoming familiar with ESXi, HTML, CSS, internal networking, DDNS, public IPs vs private IPs and NAT to a fully functioning project.
I decided to retire this project in favor of building a more up to date site that can convey information easier.

The old project has been migrated to this server, it can bee seen at the link below.
