As a Network Engineer with Sycom Technologies, Network Administrator for the Virginia Tech Corporate Research center, and recenent graduate from Radford University I have been looking for a platform to help spread some of my skills, experiences, tips and tricks.

MyLilServer started as a small project back in 2018 with the purchase a of an Old Dell R620. I had no clue what i would do with it, but put it on the table and started tinkering with it. After a while I learned about about Type 1 Hypervisors, and began using ESXi on it.

While I have had many servers running on it, everything from Debian to Windows, my greatest achievement is the original MyLilServer website. MyLilServer is an almost text based site, written in HTML and using some CSS from scratch. The virtual server was Ubuntu 18.10 running Apache. This server has been decommissioned and the project abandoned, however it is uploaded `here </original/index.html>`_. It taught me about Networking, ports, Network Area Translation, and so much more.

Feel free to hang around and read some of my articles, hopefully some will be helpful. You can also reach out via email or linked in.
