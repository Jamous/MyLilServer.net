IPv6 SLAAC and DHCP
===========================================

Types of IPv6 addresses in Windows 10
	* DHCP: DHCP is the DHCPv6 address assigned to the machine.
		* DHCP can run at the same time as SLAAC or independently.
		* Does not provide default gateway information unless a router is connected to the network for Router Solicitation and Router advertisement (RS and RA.)
	* Temporary: If SLAAC is enabled on the network a host may elect to use a SLACC address for communications with the outside world
		* There can be multiple temporary SLAAC address on a machine, and individual programs can grab ones
		* Buggy programs or process stuck in loops can open hundreds of temporary addresses.
		* A good short read on temporary addresses

	* Public: SLAAC IPV6 address
		* Can coexist with DHCPv6 address
	* Other: The other address is the Link local address
		* All IPv6 nodes will always have a link local address for neighbor discovery
		* Uses EUI-64
			* This is why the host portion of the Public and Other address are identical
